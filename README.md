# Micro-Reddit

A mini project created with Ruby on Rails to practice data modeling and database migration with Active Record.

### What I learned

* ORM (Object-Relational-Mapping)
* Understand 1:N, N:N relationships
* Use Rails generators (e.g. `rails generate model model_name`)
* Change database schema with Rails Migration
* Simple model validations
* Populate databse with faker
